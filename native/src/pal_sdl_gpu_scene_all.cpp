// The SDL_GPU scene renderer as one translation unit: every source opens with
// the scene header, which is then parsed once rather than once per file. The
// families come in the order the renderer's single source held them, the
// driver's frame run last. The build compiles only this file; native lint
// also compiles each included source independently, checking its own includes.
