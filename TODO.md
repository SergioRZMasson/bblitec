# Unfinished work

Internal work, qualification, performance and refusal defects. Capability gaps are the Limits in
[features](docs/features.md) and [UI](docs/ui.md); [audit](audit.md) tracks audit findings;
[status](docs/status.md) owns measurements.

## Qualification

- [ ] Move mixed mesh/billboard ordering into a generated draw plan after retaining source deferred-build completion order and prior stable binding order; keep equal-order/depth and camera-less refusals until those inputs and ordering-neutrality coverage exist.
- [ ] Give remaining sliced PAL code standalone concern headers that harness fixtures include.
- [ ] Android: resolve same-device emulator visual gaps and qualify the full registry on a physical device.
- [ ] iOS: qualify device bundles on hardware.
- [ ] Linux/Vulkan: every registered scene within its thresholds against same-host browser references.
- [ ] macOS/Metal: every registered scene within its thresholds against same-host browser references, fonts included, on an Apple Silicon host.

## Dependencies

- [ ] Drop `sdl-multisample-read.patch` at the release its `retire` field in `native/patches/manifest.json` names, and `png-grey-ramp-last-index.patch` once an SDL_image release builds the ramp over the last index; the manifest records each patch's upstream state.
